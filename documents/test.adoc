== Purpose
This article provides a detailed functional description of the primary hydraulic pump system (P-101).

The pump's main function is to convert rotational energy from the motor (M-205) into hydraulic pressure used to actuate the landing gear and wing flap systems. It operates in two modes: high flow/low pressure for general operation and low flow/high pressure for heavy lifting phases. The pressure sensor (S-311) reports system status.

== Operating Principle
When the main switch is engaged, the internal gerotor mechanism begins its cycle...
